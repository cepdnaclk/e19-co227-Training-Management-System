## Introduction

<b>Training Management System</b> of the Staff Development Centre(SDC) in University of Peradeniya, helps staff members to learn and grow their professional carrier, through various activities. 
But the Training Management System currently lacks an automation system. 
The objective of this project is to design and develop an automation system for the training management system at SDC.

### Problem 🔍

The Staff Development Centre faces challenges due to <b>manual and fragmented processes in managing training programs</b>.

- Inefficient participant registrations
- Complicated scheduling
- Resource allocation difficulties
- Inconsistent feedback collection
- Limited performance tracking capabilities

### Proposed Solution💡

Design and develop an automation system that addresses the following specific challenges.

- Centralized Training Management System
- Efficient Participant Registration
- Resource Allocation Optimization
- Automated Feedback Collection
- Performance Tracking System
- Reporting and Analytics Tools
- User-Friendly Interface
